<p class="lead">
  This documentation serves as the primary source for <code>/docs/specs</code> specifications,
  providing current implementation status and future migration plans under the same assumptions.

## How to Read This Documentation

Start with [Getting Started](/getting-started) for the minimal setup, then review [Core Concepts](/core-concepts) to understand the execution model. Command specifications are in [CLI Reference](/cli-reference), and distribution procedures are in [Publish Guideline](/publish-guideline).

:::tip[Policy]
Latest spec update: February 7, 2026 (`docs/specs/README.md`).
Refer to each spec's "Implementation Status" table for implemented/unimplemented items.

## Major Spec Status

| Spec | Status | Key Points |
|------|--------|------------|
| `CAPSULE_CLI_SPEC.md` | v0.3 | `capsule` acts as IPC Broker (migrated from nacelle) |
| `NACELLE_SPEC.md` | v0.3 | Focus on Source Runtime + Sandbox Enforcer |
| `DESKTOP_SPEC.md` | v0.3 | Guest Host / User Consent / Deep Link UI |
| `DRAFT_LIFECYCLE.md` | v1.2 Accepted | `[tasks]` and `[services]` separation + DAG execution |
| `DRAFT_CAPSULE_IPC.md` | v1.1 Accepted | JSON-RPC 2.0 as unified format |
| `CAPSULE_SPEC.md` | v0.1 Draft | `capsule.toml` required structure |
| `STORE_SPEC.md` | v0.1 Accepted | Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2 distribution |

## Architecture Boundaries (Smart Build, Dumb Runtime)

The current basic boundaries are three layers: `capsule-cli` handles runtime selection and IPC mediation, `nacelle` handles isolation and process execution, and `ato-desktop` handles user interaction.

**capsule-cli**: Router / IPC Broker / packaging / signing / validate / install

**nacelle**: Source runtime, supervisor, sandbox policy enforcement

**ato-desktop**: HostBridge, mode transition consent, dashboard UI
