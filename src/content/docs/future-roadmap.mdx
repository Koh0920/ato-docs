# Future Roadmap

<p class="lead">
  This shows the roadmap based on implementation phases and incomplete items
  explicitly stated in <code>docs/specs</code>, not marketing plans.
</p>

## Status Snapshot (As of 2026-02-07)

| Area | Status | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| IPC Protocol | v1.1 Accepted | Converge implementation to JSON-RPC 2.0 |
| Lifecycle | v1.2 Accepted | Unify shortcut/explicit definition operations |
| CLI | v0.3 | Gradual introduction of `capsule ipc *` commands |
| Desktop | v0.3 Partial | User Consent UI / Widget PiP |
| Store | v0.1 Accepted | Gradual migration from Go coordinator |

## Near-term: v0.3 Completion

1. **CLI IPC Broker Responsibility Completion** - Integrate Registry/RefCount/Token/Schema to capsule-cli side, enabling cross-runtime IPC.

2. **Nacelle IPC Sandbox Permission** - Implement dynamic IPC socket path permission in Seatbelt/Landlock, ensuring Token leak resistance.

3. **Desktop User Consent UI** - Implement `capsule/ui.modeChange(target_mode="app")` confirmation dialog as UI.

## Mid-term: v0.4 Expansion

The next phase focuses on "visibility and operability".

- **CLI: IPC Diagnostics Extension** - Add `capsule ipc services/call/logs/inspect`
- **Desktop: IPC Dashboard** - Visualize running Shared Services and connection status
- **Protocol: JSON-RPC Unification** - Phase out postMessage proprietary format, migrate to unified methods

## Store Roadmap

Store v0.1 is design-accepted, gradually migrating to Edge-first implementation (Workers + D1 + R2). Initial D1 LIKE search, future search infrastructure replacement through abstraction layer.

- Phase 1: API compatibility migration (don't break existing CLI/Desktop)
- Phase 2: Search abstraction enhancement (considering Meilisearch / Vectorize)
- Phase 3: Payment / license verification operational maturity

## Trust / Security Roadmap

Spec Track v0.2 focuses on "reliably rejecting what should be rejected". Signature verification failures, revoked keys, and egress control violations converge to hard errors.

| Item | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| TOFU + Fingerprint pinning | MUST | Design exists / operational strengthening |
| Revocation list application | MUST (when available) | Operational details under continuous review |
| Strict Sandbox | MUST | Gradual runtime-side response |

## Long-term Themes

- Runtime/Platform agnostic IPC and Capability compatibility (including MCP integration)
- Attestation-first publication gate and reproducible build operations
- Spec-driven development as premise, operational cycle to reduce implementation gaps
